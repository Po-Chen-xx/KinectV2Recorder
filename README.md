# KinectV2Recorder
**Authors:** [Po-Chen Wu](https://github.com/Po-Chen)

KinectV2Recorder is a Win32 program used to record the **Color**, **Depth**, and **Infrared** sequences captured from Kinect V2. These three different sequences are somehow synchronized in hardware (30 fps). The depth and infrared frames are captured in the exact same time, followed by the color frame (~ 6 ms later).

### Program Description
Color images are stored in bmp format (24-bit per pixel). Depth and infrared images are stored in pgm format (16-bit per pixel). D2D is used to achieve real-time display. I further use Intel IPP in regards to optimization. To enable IPP, please following the project setup below.
